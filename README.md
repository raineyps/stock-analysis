## 📊 Strategy Logic: PS's Analysis
The dashboard includes a specialized section for personal strategy evaluation, organized into four tabs:
1.  **Overview:** Real-time metrics and price action chart.
2.  **Technicals:** Detailed RSI and MACD analysis.
3.  **PS's Analysis:** Strategy-based entry targets and cost-averaging simulator.
4.  **Recommend Stocks:** Automated top 10 performance scanner with integrated buy targets.

### Entry Targets
*   **PS Limit I:** Today's Open adjusted by the percentage change between Yesterday's Open and Yesterday's Low.
*   **PS Limit II:** A 3% reduction from PS Limit I.
*   **ATR/EMA Targets:** Includes EMA 20, ATR Limit II (EMA 20 - 0.5 * ATR), and ATR Limit III (EMA 20 - 1.0 * ATR).

### Cost Averaging Simulator
Dynamic calculation of your new position basis with real-time feedback:
*   **Tooltips:** Detailed calculation methods visible on hover (i).
*   **Trend Indicators:** Visual cues (🟢 ↓ or 🔴 ↑) showing if the new average is better or worse than your current cost.

$$NewAvg = \frac{(CurrentAvg \times CurrentQty) + (LimitPrice \times PurchaseQty)}{CurrentQty + PurchaseQty}$$
